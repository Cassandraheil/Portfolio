      <h1> About Me</h1>
      
      <img class="me" src="images/Senior Picture.jpg" alt="me">
      
      <p>Hello! My name is Cassandra Heil! As a young fullstack developer, I work hard to expand my
        knowledge and gain experience to make myself valuable. I designed this website to polish my skills and showcase my work. If you would like to jump in and see the applications I have created, navigate directly to the portfolio page! Otherwise, I hope you enjoy learning a bit about me!</p>

        <p>After high school, I attended HACC (Harrisburg Area Community College) where I graduated with an associate‚Äôs degree in business administration. Even though I was proud of this accomplishment, I felt like I wanted a career where I could create something I could be proud of and that I could showcase to others. That's when I started looking into coding.

          In December of 2019, I attended the UPENN Coding Bootcamp to become educated on the basics of programming. Although the class was insanely challenging, I was able to complete it and learn all that I could.</p>

        <p>Some valuable skills I have aquired include:
          <ul class="skillList">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>AJAX</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
          <li>JQuery</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Firebase</li>
          <li>GitHub</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Git</li>
          <li>JSON</li>
          <li>Node</li>
          <li>Express.js</li>
          <li>MySQL</li>
          <li>data visualization</li>
          <li>Mongo</li>
          <li>React.js</li>
          <li>APIs</li>
          <li>writting Tests</li>
          <li>User Authentication</li>
          <li>Heroku</li>
          <li>ORM</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>When I'm not working on my programming skills, I am playing video games, petting my pet rabbit, or enjoying the game of Dungeons and Dragons (DnD). Yep, you guessed it, I'm a nerd, and proud of it!

When it comes to games, I thrive in the fantasy of Dungeons and Dragons because of its collaborative and creative nature! It's an excellent way to make friends and practice problem solving. This is why I encourage people to try it even if it doesn't seem like their cup of tea at first. Most DnD players love introducing people to the game. 
My other favorites are anything from The Legend of Zelda video game series. Half of the fun is the nostalgia of playing the games from my childhood and the other half is just the amazingness of the game. I love the challenges and puzzles Zelda throws at you. But my favorite part of the legend of Zelda has to be the lore behind it. The story is so intertwined and woven exquisitely between the many Zelda games. On top of all that, The legend of Zelda games are always breaking records and pushing technology to the limit. Just a wonderful franchise all together.</p>
